Minimal Visual Studio 2015 project using Angular 2.0 and ESRI JavaScript API 4.0 Beta

I'm trying to create a Visual Studio 2015 project for ESRI JavaScript API 4.0 Beta using Angular 2.  
I first created a VS project and then added files from https://github.com/jwasilgeo/angular-esri-playground.
Jacob's playground works perfectly.  My VS project loads the index.html, but fails when trying to show the map.

It would be enormously helpful to VS developers to have a project template that works for these new frameworks.
I'm hoping someone else can use this as a starting point and find how to make it work.
